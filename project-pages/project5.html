        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">I was responsible for core gameplay programming using C++ within an ECS-based architecture, focusing on clean, scalable, and maintainable systems. My main responsibilities included implementing player abilities, developing traversal mechanics, and contributing to combat systems. I also designed and integrated various enemy types and AI behaviors. I collaborated closely with design, art, animation, and level design teams to ensure smooth gameplay integration, applying advanced 3D mathematics to solve technical challenges. In addition, I mentored junior developers and supported performance optimization to help deliver a polished and responsive player experience.</div>
