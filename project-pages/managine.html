      <h2>Engine Poster</h2>
      <p>
        This poster showcases the core features of the Managine 3D engine, including real-time lighting,
        shadow mapping, and modular ECS architecture. The engine is built using C++ and OpenGL.
	<br>
	Managine including an asset management, rendering,
	animation, physics and sound system. Special emphasis lies on
	several rendering aspects, in-game resource management and
	real-time creation of objects. Based on this engine two different
	games were created and evaluated based on their performance
	and usability. On a CPU with 3.30GHz both games run with 60
	frames per seconds. For each of Managines features, around 1
	to 8 lines of codes are necessary, for integration.
	<br>
	Two different games were created with Managine. A building game, where the player has
	to manage resources and build objects to handle them and a
	puzzle game, in which a riddle has to be solved in time. Optical
	differences are the character models which uses different
	animations as well as the skyboxes. The building game makes
	use of a terrain, whereas the puzzle game only utilize 3D
	boxes to build the game world. Furthermore, the graphical user
	interface differs too. Other distinctions only concern the games
	rules. As a result both games are only distinguishable by their
	behavior and environment. Both integrates Managines engine
	and thus the engines rendering, physics, sound, animation and
	asset management system.
	<br>
	Both games were tested and the frames per seconds were
	evaluated. Measured was on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600
	CPU with 3.30GHz. On a debug build both games run with
	constants 30 fps. On the other hand, both release builds
	displayed 60 fps while playing.
	<br>
	The engines usability was measured in lines of code. For
	example to switch the camera to a free flight camera from the
	third person camera perspective and back, only requires one
	line of code. Both camera perspectives are already defined in
	Managine and only one enum triggers the change. Depending
	on what is needed, water effects can be implemented in the
	game typing four to eight lines of code. For every new light
	creation only one line of code is necessary. At last, the minimal
	amount of lines of code needed to initialize an object and place
	it into the world with its properties and physics values, is three.
