is a 3D engine including an asset management, rendering,
animation, physics and sound system. Special emphasis lies on
several rendering aspects, in-game resource management and
real-time creation of objects. Based on this engine two different
games were created and evaluated based on their performance
and usability. On a CPU with 3.30GHz both games run with 60
frames per seconds. For each of Managines features, around 1
to 8 lines of codes are necessary, for integration.
</div>
          <div class="body-text">Managine is composed of many subsystems, including an
asset management-, physics-, renderer- and sound-system.
Character animations, graphical interfaces and the handling of
game resources are supported by Managine as well. The engine
itself initializes these systems and executes them in a loop.
In addition to the systems, the engine also handles specified
actors. Actors are defined by Managine. All actors have an
update function which gets carried out by the engine.</div>
